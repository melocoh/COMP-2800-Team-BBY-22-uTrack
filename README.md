### Firestore Credentials
If you wish to help develop the application and database, please contact us through our GitHub contact information so we may include your Google account as a contributor in the Firebase project.

### Firebase Initialization
If you so choose, you may initialize Firebase CLI by following the tutorial in their [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli).

<!-- DEPRECATED -->
<!-- ### Install Node.js
Download *Node.js* from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the steps to install it.

### Initializing Firebase in Command-Line
**Note**: Before proceeding to this step, you must first have access to the application's Firebase project and have the latest version of *Node.js* installed.

1. In order to initialize Firebase CLI in the command-line terminal, you must log-in using your Google account by running this command:

```
firebase login
```

A new browser window should pop up and prompt you to log into a Google account of your choosing.

2. After logging in to your Google account, you must now navigate to your forked repository's project folder in the command-line terminal. Now install the necessary Firebase tools from Node by running this command:

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Wait for the download to finish before proceeding to the next step.

3. You must now initialize Firebase in your project folder. Do this by running this command:

```
firebase init
```
The command-line terminal will now run you through the initialization process through a series of configurations.
